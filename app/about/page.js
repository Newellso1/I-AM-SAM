        For the past 14 years, I have been working in the memorial masonry
        industry where I have honed my attention to detail and craftsmanship
        through to creating meaningful tributes for those who have lost friends
        and family dear to them. However, my passion for technology and design
        has led me to embark on new journey into the world of tech. I am mainly
        self taught but have recently completed a 12 week bootcamp put on by the
        Coders Guild which helped me cement the web development basics, since
        finishing I have focused mainly on getting to grips with React.
